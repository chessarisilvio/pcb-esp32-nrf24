i just started using kicad and i alredy figured out how to place things, view them in 3d and do the electrical connections, this is my first time so i am really happy for the result![Istantanea_2025-10-21_21-52-56.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a1ef2e941800552aed832544a5cc5fd5f8bc5025/Istantanea_2025-10-21_21-52-56.png)
the second photo is my second attempt  

## 10/22/2025 2 PM - made the spi, ce, csn, ecc... connections

those are all the connections i made, i know they are a mess seen like this but i will make them clearer when i will draw them by hand because this software is hard to use  

## 10/22/2025 10 PM - made the connections more easy
