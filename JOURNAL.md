## 10/21/2025 - Designed a modular ESP32 + NRF24 PCB and finished schematic.

i just started using kicad and i alredy figured out how to place things, view them in 3d and do the electrical connections, this is my first time so i am really happy for the result![Istantanea_2025-10-21_21-52-56.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a1ef2e941800552aed832544a5cc5fd5f8bc5025/Istantanea_2025-10-21_21-52-56.png)
the second photo is my second attempt  

## 10/22/2025 2 PM - made the spi, ce, csn, ecc... connections

those are all the connections i made, i know they are a mess seen like this but i will make them clearer when i will draw them by hand because this software is hard to use  

## 10/22/2025 10 PM - made the connections more easy

## 10/23/2025 - made the code for the esp32 nrf24 and the esp32 yellow  

![6ea31d84-19c4-44da-884c-18692a05e0bb.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5b899a88b01a4c7dcbb2d38a0ef4ac76cd1fe34a/6ea31d84-19c4-44da-884c-18692a05e0bb.png)

Added detailed step-by-step instructions for library installation and display configuration.

Provided explicit wiring tables for ESP32 and nRF24 connections.

Included comprehensive troubleshooting tips covering nRF24, WiFi, and display issues.

Improved network architecture for bidirectional communication with web interface control.

Enhanced documentation for easier setup, testing, and expansion.

These make the project more beginner-friendly and reliable for wireless and IoT experimentation.!  

## 10/24/2025 9 AM - real photo of the yellow esp32  

to help people understand this project i have fixed anything ai related as suggested, so here it is what the display text would look like in the esp32 yellow board, i have also fixed some codes and made the readme more clear.

## 10/24/2025 8 PM - fixed the boom.cvs and added 0.96" display  

i made the project more budget friendly to display text on the esp32 even if you dont have a esp32 yellow board, so now the text will be seen on a simple 0.96" display![unnamed](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTE5NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2acc4584adf8d6a9f506d2086f190ab64f510be1/unnamed.jpg)
